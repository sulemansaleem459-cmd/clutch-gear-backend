## 🔐 Authentication

The API uses **OTP-based authentication** with JWT tokens.

### Flow:

1. User requests OTP → `POST /api/v1/auth/send-otp`
2. User verifies OTP → `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-otp`
3. User receives `accessToken` and `refreshToken`
4. Use `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` for protected routes
5. Refresh token when expired → `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh-token`

## 👥 Roles

| Role    | Description                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`  | Customer - Can book services, manage vehicles, track jobs |
| `admin` | Workshop Admin - Full access to all features              |
